# Minty - Framework and Boilerplate 

![alt text](./docs/home.PNG) 

I decided to create a CSS framework and clean HTML boilerplate to streamline my static website process. As a front end designer who enjoys custom styling, I am adverse to bloaed frameworks and Libraries. Here I created my own , I call it Minty. Included is a templte website, CSS grid using a Bootstrap style 12 column grid and similar naming convention, and a pre-written table of contents and notes throughout the files so you can write hundreds of lines of code, and hopefully not create a monster.
